	Challenge: Write a program that takes 2 bytes as input
	and outputs the smallest of them.

First we're going to read the 2 bytes and put them in the
first 2 cells. Then we're going to substract 1 from each
of the first 2 cells and add 1 to the third. The cell that
hits 0 first had the smallest byte, and that number is now
in the first cell, which we output.
